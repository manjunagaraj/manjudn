	(Quick advice on the traffic scene. Getting from Royal Orchid to Koramangala can take 
from 7 mins to 45 mins – it is a simple function of the time of day and traffic scenario. 
hours (read 8:30 AM – 10:30 AM and 5:30 PM – 7:30 PM) the 45 min time frame is what you
should budget for.)

It’s worth splitting Koramangala into two sections. The area around Jyoti Nivas College has 
buzzing student vibe. Then there is 80 ft Rd Koramangala that has what could be called the
Koramangala Food Street for the string of street-side food stalls it hosts. (Koramangala ac
had a food street (read about it here) which was relocated by the Municipal authorities a 
months ago. There is hope that the authorities will allow the vendors to come back and set
street the way it was but for now all the vendors have relocated from there.)
