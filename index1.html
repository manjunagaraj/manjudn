						<h3>About</h3>
						<p> Many leaders think that technology is just
                                                 a tool to help employees better perform their jobs 
                                                 and that investment in the latest hardware/software
                                                  will keep their company competitive in its industry.
                                                   But this belief may be fatal to the companies they lead.
                                                       A recent MIT study showed why</P>

                                                  <p>First, leaders must recognize that we are in the midst 
                                                   of a technological revolution in the business world comparable
                                                  to the Industrial Revolution. The most successful companies are not 
                                                  simply doing the same things more efficiently with technology; 
                                                   rather, they are using technology to conduct business in entirely new ways.</p>
                                                      
                                                   <p>Second, leaders must recognize the silent generation 
                                                     gap in most companies between older and younger employees. 
                                                    Digital natives, those under age 35, who grew up with technology,
                                                    work much more virtually then their older colleagues and managers. 
                                                   It is important that a company's leadership understand what its younger
                                                    employees are doing and how they work, and enable them to work in the most productive and creative ways.</P>
